/*
Use for a Singleton Class
- When we only want a single instance exists for a class. For example, we don't want multiple instance of database class.


Steps to make a class Singleton

1. Use "volatile" keyword when declaring class instance to always read from and write to the main memory, bypassing thread-local caches.
    Guarantees that no other thread ever sees a partially constructed object
2. Make class instance "static" so that getInstance() static method can initialize it
3. Make constructor private so that no one can accidentally create new instance via constructor
4. Use "synchronized" keyword to make initialization thread safe
5. Use double locking to make null checking efficient
