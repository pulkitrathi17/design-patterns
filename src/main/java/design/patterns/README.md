# üìö What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They improve **readability, scalability, and maintainability**.

Many patterns overlap in purpose, leading to confusion. This guide clarifies **when to use which pattern systematically**.

## Strategy vs State vs Template Method vs Visitor

| Aspect  | Strategy                    | State                      | Template Method                         | Visitor                                  |
| ------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Purpose | Select algorithm at runtime | Change behavior with state | Define skeleton with customizable steps | Separate algorithm from object structure |
| Varies  | Algorithm                   | Behavior by state          | Steps of algorithm                      | Operations on structure                  |
| Example | Sorting strategies          | TCP connection states      | File parsing                            | AST traversal                            |

**Summary:**

* **Strategy:** Choose algorithm dynamically.
* **State:** Object behavior changes due to internal state.
* **Template:** Fixed algorithm, variable steps.
* **Visitor:** Add operations without modifying structure.

| Structure | Wraps object                     | Controls access, lazy loading | Converts interface      | Unified interface over subsystem |
| Example   | BufferedInputStream              | Virtual Proxy                 | Enumeration to Iterator | Kafka Client APIs                |

**Summary:**

* **Decorator:** Add behavior dynamically.
* **Proxy:** Control or delay object access.
* **Adapter:** Interface compatibility.
* **Facade:** Simplify subsystem usage.
