package design.patterns.behavioral.strategy;

/*
A Behavioral Design Pattern that enables selecting an algorithmâ€™s behavior at runtime by encapsulating
interchangeable algorithms (strategies) in separate classes and making them interchangeable within the context.

Real-World Analogy: Payment Processing in E-commerce. Strategy: Credit Card Payment, PayPal Payment, Crypto Payment.

Structure (Participants)
    - Strategy (Interface/Abstract Class): Defines a common interface for all supported algorithms.
    - Concrete Strategies                : Implement different versions of the algorithm.
    - Context                            : Holds a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the behavior to the strategy.
